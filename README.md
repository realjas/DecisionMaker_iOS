Decision Maker for iOS

This is a simple app to help the indecisive make decisions.

History:
After hanging out with my family and us struggling to come do a decision as to what we were going to eat I asked my step-brother to look up an app the make the decision for us.  There wasn't one, so the following day I learned Swift and got to makeing the app for myself. :)


TO DO:
Update the design to make it pretty.

Update from Swift 4 to Swift5.
