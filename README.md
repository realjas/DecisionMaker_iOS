Decision Maker for iOS

This is a simple app to help the indecisive make decisions.

History:
After hanging out with my family and us struggling to come do a decision as to what we were going to eat I asked my step-brother to look up an app the make the decision for us.  There wasn't one, so the following day I learned Swift and got to makeing the app for myself. :)


TO DO:

Redesign entire app.

Correct result font size to be dynamic

Correct result "bubble" scaling to fit/look correctly on screen in both potrait and landscape

Update Icon with redesign and add the required update of a 1024x1024 version.
 
Make decide button dynamic between coin flip when there are no entries in field to "decide" when there are more than one fields with values.
