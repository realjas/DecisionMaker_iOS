Decision Maker for iOS

This is a simple app to help the indecisive make decisions.

History:
After hanging out with my family and us struggling to come do a decision as to what we were going to eat I asked my step-brother to look up an app the make the decision for us.  There wasn't one, so the following day I learned Swift and got to makeing the app for myself. :)


TO DO:

Add an icon of a martini glass or beer in the lower right hand corner that activates "drunk mode".  When tapped no matter what the options you provide are the result is always "DON'T DO IT!\rGO HOME!"

Fix the disaster that is the UI, currently. :)

Redesign entire app adding the now-required 1024x1024 icon.

Correct result font size to be dynamic.

Correct result "bubble" scaling to fit/look correctly on screen in both potrait and landscape.

Make dynamic button more efficient merge for loops into a function that provides an array as a return.


DONE:

Add coin flipping sound effect when in "FLIP COIN" mode vs "DECIDE" mode.

Added comments to make the code easier to understand.

Made a custom button subclass of UIButton to add custom behaviors.

Update App from Swift 3 to Swift 5.

Make decide button dynamic between "FLIP COIN" when there are no entries in field to "DECIDE" when there are more than one fields with values.
